"Falun Dafa is also known as Falun Gong. It is a spiritual meditation discipline that includes five exercises that look like qi gong, and teachings that revolve around the three core principles of Truthfulness, Compassion, and Forbearance. Falun Dafa was introduced to the public in 1992 and swiftly gained popularity.

You may have heard that Falun Dafa practitioners are persecuted in China today. This started in 1999, when tens of millions of people practiced Falun Dafa meditation in parks throughout China. Fearful of its popularity as an independent ideology outside its control, the Chinese Communist Party launched a nationwide persecution campaign trying to wipe it out. Still, over two decades of torture, imprisonment, and mass murder later, these spiritual-seekers in China persevere in their faith and continue to resist through nonviolence."
